Project: Template engine plus

Requirements: Python

The original project is written by Ned Batchelder at [500lines/template-engine](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/tree/master/template-engine).It is a simple template engine to generate HTML in a web application.To keep that code small, the author leaved out some interesting ideas which were metioned at the last of the [article](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/blob/master/template-engine/template-engine.markdown). Now, we wil implement them one by one.

Features:

- [ ] Template inheritance and inclusion

- [ ] Custom tags

- [ ] Automatic escaping

- [ ] Arguments to filters

- [ ] Complex conditional logic like else and elif

- [ ] Loops with more than one loop variable

- [ ] Whitespace control




To run the tests::

    $ python -m unittest discover
